Current Dev Stage of Weaponry : Finished for first release

-- > reload check if there an reload stance with an higher index before setting that it completed (if no reload[index + 1] then finish = true)

-- > ammo bar is rendered on the local client + durability bar is tricked to show up to give a small indicator on the ammount of primary ability ammo that the weapon has

-- > allow the players to add an offset for the general rendering position of the ammo bar

-- > add postFire (pump/lever action for exemple) to allow creation of non auto refill weapon...
	maybe also allow the weapon to have persistance on if the postFire has been played and if it automaticaly played or not.

-- > make weapons

todo :
--> config screen for the renderer

idea for next updates : 

--> Rocket Launcher
--> Grenade Launcher
--> Basicaly more weapons

-+> Weapons Quality/Level Upgrade
-+> Weapons Attachment through new bench or item that open a pane to change attachment
--> New Bow
--> Crossbows... just disguising a gun should be enough

postPone :

-- > allow to override the projectile action with hitscan for insanely fast projectile representation (a laser or sniper round for exemple)...
	possibly with "isHitscan" : true has parameters... maybe make so that the projectile spawn one or two block distance from destination so that it easier to 
	create and/or convert weapons
